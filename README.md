# LamaGlama

Hello there, this is a little page I made as a challenge for the Zappos frontend summer internship. The guidelines were simple: make a 1-5 page site about llamas, include a bit about yourself, make it look cool.  I mainly used HTML5/CSS3 with a dash of JS and jQuery to make this site since I haven't had much experience with JS libraries/frameworks (although I would've loved to have learned Angular and use it here; but hey, maybe for another time) I used this library (http://balupton.github.io/jquery-scrollto/) for smooth scrolling, and this one (http://callmenick.com/post/animated-resizing-header-on-scroll) for the resizing header.
