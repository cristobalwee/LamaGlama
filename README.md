# LamaGlama

Hello there, this is a little page I made as a challenge for the Zappos frontend summer internship. The guidelines were simple: make a 1-5 page site about llamas, include a bit about yourself, make it look cool. I mainly used HTML5/CSS3 and a little bit of JS with jQuery (I used this library here http://balupton.github.io/jquery-scrollto/ for smooth scrolling, and this one here http://callmenick.com/post/animated-resizing-header-on-scroll for the resizing header). Sources for images and facts outlined below.
