Hello there, this is a little page I made as a challenge for the Zappos frontend summer internship. The guidelines were simple: make a 1-5 page site about llamas, include a bit about yourself, make it look cool.  I mainly used HTML5/CSS3 with a dash of JS and jQuery to make this site since I haven't had much experience with JS libraries/frameworks (although I would've loved to have learned Angular and use it here; but hey, maybe for another time). For responsiveness, I just used CSS media queries since I'm not very familiar with mobile-friendly development (the class I'm currently in will go over responsive web development with foundation in a couple of weeks). I also tried to handle form submission with a few lines of PHP, but unfortunately gh pages doesn't support it at this time, so the form submission is currently not working. I used this library (http://balupton.github.io/jquery-scrollto/) for smooth scrolling, and this one (http://callmenick.com/post/animated-resizing-header-on-scroll) for the resizing header. Sources for images and facts outlined below.

About myself: I haven't had much experience with web development, but I find that I love it, and I want to learn all there is to it. I'm currently taking the web programming class at my university, which focuses on the MEAN stack, but I'm also trying to learn a little React.js and React native on my own (because let's be honest, it seems awesome). Despite the fact that I've mainly taken classes in software development and systems programming, I feel like I don't enjoy nearly as much as I do frontend development and UI/UX design on web and iOS.
